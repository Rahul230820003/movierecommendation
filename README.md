## 🔄 How It Works

This system uses content-based filtering to recommend movies based on genre similarity:

1. 📊 Movie genres are converted to a binary matrix using MultiLabelBinarizer
2. 🧮 K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm finds movies with similar genre patterns
3. 🔍 User searches for a movie they like
4. 📋 System returns movies with similar genres
